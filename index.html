<!-- the defference between xhtml and html and their versions?
              
			  XHTML stands for eXtensible HyperText Markup Language.
			   It is markup used to design websites and webpages.
               it is much more strict than ordinary HTML, and is based on both XML and HTML.
               XHTML is also easier to read for humans. 
			   XHTML's XML syntax is more expressive than HTML
			   (for example, arbitrary namespaces are not allowed in HTML).
			     XHTML uses an XML syntax,
				 while HTML uses a pseudo-SGML syntax
			  HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
			  It is a basic markup language used to make any web pages
			   that further comprise to form websites.
			   XHTML VERSIONS=
			  1. XHTML1.1 
			  Finalized on  2004
			  The OMA added partial suppoort for the scripting module and partial support
			  for intrinsic events.
			  2.XHTML 1.2
			  Finalized on 2007
			  It expands the capabilities of xhtml MP 1.1 with full support for the forms module
			  and OMA text input modes.
			  3.xhtml 1.3
			  uses the xhtml basic 1.1 document type definition
			  which includes the target module .
			  In this version specifications are updated to DOM level 3 specifications.
			  4.xhtml 2.0
			  It is the new version of xhtml 
			  Able to  make a clean break from the past by  discarding the requirement of backward compatibility.
